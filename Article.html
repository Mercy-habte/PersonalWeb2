                <h1 style="color: black;font-weight: bold;">A Problem in Need of a Creative Solution</h1>
               <p style="color: black;"> In the 1870s, newspapers and printers faced a very specific and very costly problem. Photography was a new and exciting medium at the time. Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody could figure out how to print images quickly and cheaply.
                For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s, they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph onto a steel plate by hand. These plates were used to press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses. 
                This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time consuming and expensive.
                The man who invented a solution to this problem was named Frederic Eugene Ives. He went on to become a trailblazer in the field of photography and held over 70 patents by the end of his career. His story of creativity and innovation, which I will share now, is a useful case study for understanding the 5 key steps of the creative process.

                <h1 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">A Flash of Insight</h1>
               <p style="color: black;"> Ives got his start as a printer’s apprentice in Ithaca, New York. After two years of learning the ins and outs of the printing process, he began managing the photographic laboratory at nearby Cornell University. He spent the rest of the decade experimenting with new photography techniques and learning about cameras, printers, and optics.

                In 1881, Ives had a flash of insight regarding a better printing technique.
                
                “While operating my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the problem of halftone process,” Ives said. “I went to bed one night in a state of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in the morning saw before me, apparently projected on the ceiling, the completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”
                
                Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his printing approach in 1881. He spent the remainder of the decade improving upon it. By 1885, he had developed a simplified process that delivered even better results. The Ives Process, as it came to be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x and remained the standard printing technique for the next 80 years.
                
                Alright, now let's discuss what lessons we can learn from Ives about the creative process.

               <p style="color: black;">
                Darius Foroux writes about the battle most of us face between being happy and feeling fulfilled, in life.
We love doing things that make us happy. From going on holiday to buying a new car, we keep chasing that next nugget of happiness.
If you change it up and look at happiness as being a byproduct of your actions, choices and decisions that involve working towards a larger purpose, you’ll begin to notice how wonderful life really can be. True happiness is derived from moments of interaction and connection.
I’m happiest when doing something useful for somebody else, whether it be a friend, family member, colleague or even a stranger. When I’ve done something valuable for them, they’re happy which makes me happy!
Find something useful to do for someone. Do it. Let me know how you feel afterwards.

                <h1 style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">Relax Dude — Take It Easy On Yourself</h1>
               <p style="color: black;"> One of my new, favourite writers here on Medium Johan Rosén, published a post on taking some time to yourself.
                It was encouraging to see another writer find value in taking a break to relax. I confirm that when we let our minds breathe and relax, we return better, faster and stronger.
                We allow our deepest thoughts to surface.
                It’s important that we maintain balance in our lives. While we’re living busy schedules, it’s important that we’re able to give our 100% when we absolutely need to. Don’t waste your energy doing things that won’t help you down the track.
                It’s okay to relax and spend some time winding down.
                I don’t know about you, but balance in life makes it easier. If you like to chill a lot, try to mix it up with more hustle. If you’re the opposite, try to find pauses during the day. The more you experiment, the better you understand my intuition says.
